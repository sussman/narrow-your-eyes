This game is a humorous text adventure (["interactive fiction"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)) originally written as part of a 'tribute' album of interactive fiction that pays homage to the "Apollo 18" album by They Might Be Giants.   It was slapped together in a few short weeks, and is a very short game.

It's written in the [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) programming language, and compiles into bytecode that can be executed on a [Z-machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine) interpreter (or in this case, a Glulx interpreter.)

(Because the source text straddles the fuzzy line between "code" and "fiction", we've released it on the Creative Commons Attribution - Noncommercial - Share Alike 3.0 license.)

## To play the game ##

  1. Grab the latest .gblorb file from the Download bubble to the right.
  1. Grab a nice interpreter to play the game, preferably one that supports newer **graphics and sound** features of GLK-based text adventures.  Try either [Spatterlight](http://ccxvii.net/spatterlight/download/spatterlight-0.5.0.zip) for Mac, [Glulxe](http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/programming/glulx/interpreters/glulxe/WinGlulxeInstaller.exe) for Windows, or [Gargoyle](http://ifarchive.flavorplex.com/indexes/if-archiveXinterpreters-multiXgargoyle.html) for Linux.
  1. Load the game into the interpreter to play.


_If you've never played interactive fiction before_:  read this simple [crib sheet](http://www.microheaven.com/IFGuide/step3.html) to give you a sense of how the command parser works.  It's a limited vocabulary, fairly easy to master.


## To modify or compile the game ##

Clone the mercurial repository using the instructions on the Source tab.  Read the README file for further instructions.  Of course, we recommend you play the game first, unless you want spoilers.  :-)
